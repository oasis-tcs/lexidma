    <title>Modelling variants</title>
    <para>We have two entries in our lexicographic resource, one for the headword "colour" and one
        for the headword "color". We want to create a relation to represent the fact that these are
        spelling variants. One of the entries is fully fleshed-out (has a sense with a definition,
        an example etc) while the other one os only skeletal: its only purpose is to serve as the
        origin of a navigable link to the other entry. </para>
