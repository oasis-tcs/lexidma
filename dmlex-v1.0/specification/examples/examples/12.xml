    <title>Modelling parts and wholes</title>
    <para>We have three entries with one sense each: "glasses", "microscope" and "lens". We want to
        represent the fact that "lens" is a meronym of both "glasses" and "microscope", and
        simultaneously that "glasses" and "microscope" are both holonyms of "lens".</para>
