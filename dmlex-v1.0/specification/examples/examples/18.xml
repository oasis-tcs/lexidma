    <title>Modelling subentries (at sense level)</title>
    <para>We have an entry for the word "bible" and another entry for the expression "the Bible". We
        want to make sure that, when a human user is viewing the entry for "bible", the entry for
        "the Bible" is shown as a subentry of it, as if it were its first sense.</para>
    <example>
        <title>Pseudocode</title>
        <programlisting>
- lexicographicResource (uri: http://example.com, langCode: en)
    - entry (id: the-bible, headword: the Bible)

            - definition (text: the book considered holy by Christians)
    - entry (id: bible, headword: bible)
        - sense (id: bible-1)
        - sense (id: bible-2)
