  <title>Controlled vocabularies module</title>
  <para>
    This module changes the definition of several attributes in several objects
    (such as partOfSpeech.value, inflectedForm.indicator, label.value)
    from free open string (= can take any text) to a reference to a controlled vocabulary.
  </para>
  <para>
    This module adds features to the lexicographicResource data type for specifying
    what those controlled vocabularies, either by listing them explicitely
    or by referring to external authority.
  </para>
  <para>
    The module makes it possible to model complex contraints on the values that
    the various attributes can take. For example, the partOfSpeech.value attribute
    takes different values depending on whether its parent is
    entry or headwordTranslation, and if headwordTranslation, depending on what
    the headwordTranslation's language is.
  </para>
  <para>
    TBD.
