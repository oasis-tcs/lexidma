  <title>Collocations module</title>
  <para>
    This module makes it possible to organize the examples inside a sense into groups
    based on the headword's collocate.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that this is basically just a mechanism for grouping examples.
    If implementors want to do more complicated things with collocations,
    such as giving them definition and translations,
    then they should treat them as separate (multiword) entries,
    and use the linking module to transclude them as subentries.

    TBD.
